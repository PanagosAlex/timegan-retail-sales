# TimeGAN Retail Sales

This repository contains a TimeGAN implementation applied to a retail sales dataset.

## Overview

TimeGAN is a model designed for generating realistic time-series data. This project demonstrates how to preprocess retail sales data, train a TimeGAN, and generate synthetic time series sequences.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x

## Dataset Preparation
1. Format your data as a NumPy array with shape:  
   `(num_samples, sequence_length, num_features)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PanagosAlex/timegan-retail-sales.git
   cd timegan-retail-sales
